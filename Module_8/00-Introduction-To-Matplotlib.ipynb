    "We'll now take an in-depth look at the Matplotlib package for visualization in Python.\n",
    "Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack.\n",
    "It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002, originally as a patch to IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting via gnuplot from the IPython command line.\n",
    "IPython's creator, Fernando Perez, was at the time scrambling to finish his PhD, and let John know he wouldn’t have time to review the patch for several months.\n",
    "John took this as a cue to set out on his own, and the Matplotlib package was born, with version 0.1 released in 2003.\n",
    "It received an early boost when it was adopted as the plotting package of choice of the Space Telescope Science Institute (the folks behind the Hubble Telescope), which financially supported Matplotlib’s development and greatly expanded its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Matplotlib’s most important features is its ability to play well with many operating systems and graphics backends.\n",
    "Matplotlib supports dozens of backends and output types, which means you can count on it to work regardless of which operating system you are using or which output format you wish.\n",
    "This cross-platform, everything-to-everyone approach has been one of the great strengths of Matplotlib.\n",
    "It has led to a large user base, which in turn has led to an active developer base and Matplotlib’s powerful tools and ubiquity within the scientific Python world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, however, the interface and style of Matplotlib have begun to show their age.\n",
    "Newer tools like ggplot and ggvis in the R language, along with web visualization toolkits based on D3js and HTML5 canvas, often make Matplotlib feel clunky and old-fashioned.\n",
    "Still, I'm of the opinion that we cannot ignore Matplotlib's strength as a well-tested, cross-platform graphics engine.\n",
    "Recent Matplotlib versions make it relatively easy to set new global plotting styles (see [Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Style Sheets](11-Settings-and-Stylesheets.ipynb)), and people have been developing new packages that build on its powerful internals to drive Matplotlib via cleaner, more modern APIs—for example, Seaborn (discussed in [Visualization With Seaborn](14-Visualization-With-Seaborn.ipynb)), [ggpy](http://yhat.github.io/ggpy/), [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org/), [Altair](http://altair-viz.github.io/), and even Pandas itself can be used as wrappers around Matplotlib's API.\n",
    "Even with wrappers like these, it is still often useful to dive into Matplotlib's syntax to adjust the final plot output.\n",
    "For this reason, I believe that Matplotlib itself will remain a vital piece of the data visualization stack, even if new tools mean the community gradually moves away from using the Matplotlib API directly."

    "#### Plotting from a script\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Matplotlib from within a script, the function ``plt.show()`` is your friend.\n",
    "``plt.show()`` starts an event loop, looks for all currently active figure objects, and opens one or more interactive windows that display your figure or figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, you may have a file called *myplot.py* containing the following:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# ------- file: myplot.py ------\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",

    "```\n",
    "$ python myplot.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``plt.show()`` command does a lot under the hood, as it must interact with your system's interactive graphical backend.\n",
    "The details of this operation can vary greatly from system to system and even installation to installation, but matplotlib does its best to hide all these details from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to be aware of: the ``plt.show()`` command should be used *only once* per Python session, and is most often seen at the very end of the script.\n",

    "## Architecture of Matplotlib\n",
    "Matplotlib has a 3 layer architecture, Backend, Artist and Scripting, organised logically as a stack. Scripting is an API using which developers create the graphs. Artist is the one which does actual job of creating the graph internally. Backend is where the graph is displayed.\n",
    "### Backend Layer\n",
    "This is the bottom most layer where the graphs are displyed onto an output device. This can be any of the User Interfaces that Matplotlib supports. These are two types of Backends. User Interface Backends(for use in pygtk, wxpython, tkinter, qt4, or macosx etc. also referred to as “interactive backends”), and Hardcopy Backends to make image files (PNG, SVG, PDF, PS; also referred to as “non-interactive backends”). We will see how to configure to use any of these backends in later chapters\n",
    "### Artist Layer\n",
    "This is the middle layer of the stack. Matplotlib uses the artist object to draw various elements of the graph. So every element(see below elements of a Figure) we see in the graph is an artist. This layer provides object oriented API for plotting gaphs with maximum flexibility. This interface is meant for seasoned Python programmers, who can create complex dashboard applications.\n",
    "### Scripting Layer\n",
    "This is the topmost layer of the stack. This layer provides a simple interface for creating graphs. This is meant for use by end users who don't have much programming expertise. This is called as pyplot API."
