    "## Principal Component Analysis Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we have discussed the use of principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction, for visualization of high-dimensional data, for noise filtering, and for feature selection within high-dimensional data.\n",
    "Because of the versatility and interpretability of PCA, it has been shown to be effective in a wide variety of contexts and disciplines.\n",
    "Given any high-dimensional dataset, I tend to start with PCA in order to visualize the relationship between points (as we did with the digits), to understand the main variance in the data (as we did with the eigenfaces), and to understand the intrinsic dimensionality (by plotting the explained variance ratio).\n",
    "Certainly PCA is not useful for every high-dimensional dataset, but it offers a straightforward and efficient path to gaining insight into high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA's main weakness is that it tends to be highly affected by outliers in the data.\n",
    "For this reason, many robust variants of PCA have been developed, many of which act to iteratively discard data points that are poorly described by the initial components.\n",
    "Scikit-Learn contains a couple interesting variants on PCA, including ``RandomizedPCA`` and ``SparsePCA``, both also in the ``sklearn.decomposition`` submodule.\n",
    "``RandomizedPCA``, which we saw earlier, uses a non-deterministic method to quickly approximate the first few principal components in very high-dimensional data, while ``SparsePCA`` introduces a regularization term (see ``In Depth: Linear Regression``) that serves to enforce sparsity of the components."
